## Introduction
This is a sample application written on the assignment briefly described below.
To architect this android application we are using the Uncle Bob's clean architecture approach.


## Assignment description
The main goal of this assignment is to build a simple demo application that contains two screens: video feed and user profile.
The video feed shows full-screen posts with video and some user information. We could scroll the feed vertically. 
Data to display this feed is packed in the application's assets folder.
Clicking on any item will take us to a specific user profile screen.


## Result
In this project, you can see a general approach to the architecture of the application.
We have different modules: app, data, domain, presentation, common.
We use Single Activity and Fragments to display user interface. 
Hilt library used for dependency injection.

It would be great to also have feature modules here and move it to Jetpack Compose.
Jectpack Navigation could be used instead of fragment manager approach. 

In the process of completing the assignment, I identified for myself some areas that I should remind myself or study in more detail. 

Some things should be improved, but there was not enough time.
